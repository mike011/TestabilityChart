# Definition of Done

Version 0.1
- Percents on verticals
- Dates on bottom
- Bubbles to show size of change
- When you click on bubble the commit is shown.
- Size is determined by looking at the git log --numstat values for only java files
- 90% code coverage
-- ALL COMPLETED

Version 0.15
- Specify by passing into program type of source code
- Specify by configuration file program type
- Sample with log file and jar.
- HTTP Link to change description
-- ALL COMPLETED

Version 0.17 - Be able to handle a larger project (qt)
- Fix URL path for different projects
-- COMPLETE
- Change title for current project.
-- COMPLETE
- Add in version name in title.
-- COMPLETE
- Be able to set properties file by passing in system variable.
-- COMPLETE
- For unit tests only statically import.
-- COMPLETE
- Remove passing in arguments and base only on property file.
- Legend becomes ridiculously large
- Grab screen shots for projects and have them show up in github as examples.
- Large commits dominate the screen and this makes the graph less effective. So Bubble size should 
not size determined by size of commit, but rather relative to other bubbles. Example B1 = 50 lines 
changed, B2 = 5 lines changed, B3 = 10 lines changed. Currently you'd have one massive bubble, and 
two very very small bubbles. What if B1 was just a size larger then B2 which was a size larger then
B3? 

Version 0.20
- Use Branch to do work in.
- Filter by user
- Filter by size or ratio to highlight the most suspicious commits
- Filter by path in the commit tree

Version 0.25
- Better size determination.

Version 0.3
- Showing each bubble as a pie chart of different file types, and each of their respective tests.
- Display trend line per team or per area of code
- Use complexity or test coverage metrics instead of lines of code

Version 0.4
- Add merge and refactoring commit visualizations
- Color coding commits to stories, and adding sorting and filters to identify stories with high suspected tech debt.
- Tie in bug fixes and trace them back to the original commitsâ€™ bubbles
