<B>Version 0.25 - Better size determination.</B>
<UL>
<LI>Large commits dominate the screen and this makes the graph less effective. So Bubble size should 
not size determined by size of commit, but rather relative to other bubbles. Example B1 = 50 lines 
changed, B2 = 5 lines changed, B3 = 10 lines changed. Currently you'd have one massive bubble, and 
two very very small bubbles. What if B1 was just a size larger then B2 which was a size larger then
B3? </LI>
