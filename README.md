##Launching
You have create a common.properties file in the same directory as the jar file. You can optionally set the directory
to run from by setting the system variable PROJECT_FOLDER. Example: -DPROJECT_FOLDER=../samples/qt/

##Manditory Arguments
At minimum you have to set:
<table border="1">
<tr><td>Option</td><td>Explanation</td><td>Examples</td></tr>
<tr><td>log.file</td><td>the name of the file that contains the results of running "git log --numstat"</td><td>out.txt</td></tr>
<tr><td>types</td><td>what type of source code is your project using?</td><td>java, cpp, c</td></tr>
</table>

##Optional Arguments
You can optionally also set:
<table border="1">
<tr><td>Option</td><td>Explanation</td><td>Examples</td></tr>
<tr><td>base.url</td><td>for commits where on the Internet can you link too</td><td>http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt/commit/</td></tr>
<tr><td>project.name</td><td>The name of the project that can show up on the chart</td><td>QT</td></tr>
<tr><td>debug</td><td>Enable or disable debugging, disabled by default</td><td>TRUE, FALSE</td></tr>

<LI>Grab screen shots for projects and have them show up in GIT hub as examples. </LI>
<LI>Remove passing in arguments and base only on property file. </LI>
<LI>Legend becomes ridiculously large for large projects and dominates the screen. Maybe a smaller
scrollable window is needed? No possible with jFreechart instead don't show the table for commits greater then 10.</LI>
<LI>Chart and Panel are fixed in size, they should be dynamic</LI>
